            <h1>landscape</h1>
        </section>
        <div class="textbox"><p>A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or human-made features, often considered in terms of their aesthetic appeal.[1] A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as mountains, hills, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions. Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity.</p></div>
        <section id="bg2" class="section parallax">
            <h1>mountain</h1>
        </section>
        <div class="textbox"><p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock.
            Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area,
            and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. 
            A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.</p></div>
        <section id="bg3" class="section parallax">
            <h1>sunset</h1>
        </section>
        <div class="textbox"><p>Sunset (or sundown) is the disappearance of the Sun at the end of the Sun path, below the horizon of the Earth (or any other astronomical object in the Solar System) due to its rotation. As viewed from everywhere on Earth, it is a phenomenon that happens approximately once every 24 hours, except in areas close to the poles. The equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.</p></div>
        <section id="bg4" class="section parallax">
            <h1>trees</h1>
        </section>
        <div class="textbox"><p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.</p></div>
